# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm David Morrison, a solutions architect and tech lead passionate about crafting thoughtful, forward-thinking web solutions. With 20+ years in full-stack developmentâ€”including deep Drupal expertise, Laravel, React, and AI integrationsâ€”I approach every project as an opportunity to solve meaningful problems while mentoring teams and strengthening technical foundations. Currently available for new opportunities.

## About My Repositories

Currently, most of my active projects are kept in private repositories while they're in development. This allows me to:
- Refine code quality before public release
- Protect intellectual property during early stages
- Ensure projects meet my standards before sharing

## Looking for Code Samples?

If you've been referred here to review my work or code samples, I'd be happy to share access to relevant private repositories. Please reach out to me directly:

**Contact Methods:**
- **LinkedIn**: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmorrison01/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidmorrison01/) - Send me a direct message
- **Professional Email**: Available upon request through LinkedIn connection

*I prefer LinkedIn messaging for initial contact as it provides professional context.*

When contacting me, please include:
- Your name and organization (if applicable)
- Which projects or types of code samples you're interested in
- The context of your request (job application, collaboration, etc.)

## Current Focus

I am currently devoting my time to deep-diving into AI integrations, optimized vibe & context coding practices, and Drupal 11 (including novel contrib modules development). I'm also working with headless applications with React & Vue.js, distributable project containerization, AWS platforms with IAC and Terraform management, balanced TDD and BDD dev workflow practices, CI/CD with Jenkins & Ansible, and backend management with Node.js, Angular, and Python.

## Public Contributions

As I complete projects and they're ready for public consumption, they'll appear here. Check back periodically for updates!
